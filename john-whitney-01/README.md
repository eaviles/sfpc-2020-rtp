In this sketch I'm trying to replicate the circles that appear [at 3:15](https://youtu.be/TbV7loKp69s?t=196) in John Whitney's Catalog 1961 video. I noticed there's a line of circles that rotates really fast, creating the illusion of many circles. I tried to do the same in code, changing the colors based on time.

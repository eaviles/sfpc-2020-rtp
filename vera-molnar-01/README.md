# vera-molnar-01

A recreation of Vera Molnár's Hommage à Dürer (1990). 25 squares composed of 16 cells have the numbers 1 to 16 in random positions. A line is drawn from the top-left square passing cell by cell in numeric order. The line continues to the right, then goes to the below row, continues in oposite direction to the left. And so on. There's a small randomnization in the `x` and `y` coordinates to copy the effect of the physical threads used in the original piece.
